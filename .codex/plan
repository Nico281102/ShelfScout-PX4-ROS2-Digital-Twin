This plan will help fix the simulator mavlink timeout issues step-by-step.

1. Collect diagnostic information: list running PX4/Gazebo processes and tail PX4 log to confirm poll timeout pattern.
2. Inspect mission runner log for additional errors or missing MAVLink bridge startup.
3. Identify root cause (likely micro XRCE agent or RTPS bridge not running) and apply fix to orchestrator.
