# Quickstart (coming soon)

The full quickstart will land once the multi-drone branch is merged. Meanwhile:
- Follow `docs/environment_setup.md` to prepare your machine.
- Launch the single-drone stack with `./scripts/run_ros2_system.sh --gui|--headless` using parameters from `config/sim/default.yaml`.
- See `docs/mission_language.md` and `docs/mission_v1.md` for the mission schema used by `mission_runner`.
